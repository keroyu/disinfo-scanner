# Specification Quality Checklist: Video Incremental Update

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the planning phase.

### Key Strengths:
- Clear user stories with prioritization (P1, P2)
- Comprehensive functional requirements organized by category
- Measurable success criteria focused on user outcomes
- Well-defined edge cases covering error scenarios
- Proper entity definitions without implementation details
- All requirements are testable and specific

### Notes:
- Specification successfully avoids implementation details while remaining concrete
- Success criteria are properly technology-agnostic
- Edge cases comprehensively cover error handling and boundary conditions
- Ready to proceed with `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` if additional questions arise
